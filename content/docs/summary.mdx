Samuel Wagan Watson's short story The Release opens with two men in a car. Danny driving, Bull quiet in the passenger seat threading their way through backroads in the South Burnett region of Queensland as the last light fails. It ends with one man scattering the other's ashes onto Wakka Wakka Country. 
<br/>
The reader inhabits a present. A drive through the dark Queensland valleys, only to discover the entire present was memory: Bull has been dead, his ashes carried in a "PERSONAL PROPERTY" bag stamped by a prison official, and Danny has been talking to him the whole way. The title does triple duty. It refers to Bull's release from prison. It refers to the release of his remains into the land of his ancestors. And it refers to the story's own structural release of information. The withheld truth that transforms every line that came before.
