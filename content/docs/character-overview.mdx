- Danny's cousin and best friend until being sent to a prison near Wacol, presumably Wolston Correctional Centre
- The image below is of Boggo Road Gaol
  - closed in 1989
  - famous for poor conditions and rioting.
- Probably laid to rest at Centenary Memorial Gardens in Wolston.
- Sent to prison for alcohol and heroin use as "painkillers", also used meth
- Used to do rodeo where he cracked his pelvis and couldn't do much afterwards
- Childhood dream was working on the mountain ridges
  - That dream is fulfilled posthumously - his ashes fly into the ridges
- The dialogue Bull "says" is just Danny's memories
- Embodies the systemic cycle that criminalises Indigenous disadvantage: injury → addiction → incarceration → death.
