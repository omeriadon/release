  <TabsContent value="racism">
    The theme of racism is frequently brought up throughout the story: 
    <Accordions type="single">
      <Accordion value="racism-1" title={<span className="new-york" style={{ color: 'var(--color-fd-muted-foreground)', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>But the people out here had a gentle way as they moved. Arthritic hate. A bent neck that eased an arch at stranger.</span>}>
        The use of sentence length and exclusive language to construct the idea of racial discrimination, highlighting the hatred and views of dominancy held by those who have not yet adapted to the new times. Furthermore, this reflects upon a modern day society, how the lack of respect is still deemed to be absent in many towns who still share xenophobic views towards First Nations peoples.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion value="racism-2" title={<span className="new-york" style={{ color: 'var(--color-fd-muted-foreground)', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>White-folk kept to their pub on the left ... the black-folk kept to their places across the way.</span>}>
        Anaphora constructs the idea of separation between "black" and "white" folk, juxtaposing the modern day views of acceptance, with explicit emphasis on the racial discrimination Indigenous people are still up against to this day. Additionally, the italicizing of the words "white-folk" and "black-folk" foregrounds the theme of marginalization as classifying them as two different species rather than of being human, targeting the common perspectives of Aboriginal people face in the contemporary world.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion value="racism-3" title={<span className="new-york" style={{ color: 'var(--color-fd-muted-foreground)', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>A blackfulla driving a new, registered and reliable vehicle could even warrant a search in this deadness.</span>}>
        The irony of a new, registered and reliable vehicle being able to warrant a search implicitly articulating the idea racial profiling, constructing the idea that Indigenous Australians are not deemed suitable to have money, let alone a car, in in certain rural towns of Australia. It reflects the common stereotyping Australians have about Aboriginal People, criticizing the false pretenses and beliefs that must be eradicated from society.

  <TabsContent value="grief">
    The theme of failing relationships and loss of a loved one has been represented throughout the story as well, through Danny's commentary on how their lives had panned out going separate ways, and then the final scene at the end.
    <Accordions type="single">
      <Accordion value="grief-1" title={<span className="new-york" style={{ color: 'var(--color-fd-muted-foreground)', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>Some of the bricks had fallen from the childhood bond the men had built together.</span>}>
        The use of metaphor helps to shape the way the audience sees the relationship between Danny and Bull. It represents how whilst their connection still exists, it had been weakened through decades of differences, having a vast impact on the strength of their bond. This is a reflection of the real world, where people do separate to follow their own paths, however reminds the reader the importance of holding on to friendships past childhood, past school, and on into the future.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion value="grief-2" title={<span className="new-york" style={{ color: 'var(--color-fd-muted-foreground)', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>"There ya go Bull ... There ya go ..." Danny and Bull ... Bull and Danny ... Amigos ...</span>}>
        Placeholder paragraph for Grief & Loss, Quote 2.

  <TabsContent value="dehumanisation">
    How Aboriginal People used to be treated has also been mentioned throughout the text, describing how torturous and inhumane such behaviours and attitudes were.
    <Accordions type="single">
      <Accordion value="dehumanisation-1" title={<span className="new-york" style={{ color: 'var(--color-fd-muted-foreground)', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>Danny looked over his shoulder briefly thinking he might see the lights of Cherbourg Mission behind the township, but there wasn't even a firefly's chance. Out of mind, out of sight.</span>}>
        The metaphor of there not being a firefly's chance represents the impossibility of noticing the Cherbourg mission. Representing how hopeless the situation is, with there not even being the smallest chance in the world, it brings up the theme attempt to erase Australia's dark past and treatment of Aboriginal people. The phrase, out of mind, out of sight, is a common saying when people want to forget about something, in this case the historical site of the Cherbourg Mission. The cruel conditions and methods of treatment of Aboriginal People the government wants erased from history signify how much Australia has changed yet fails to recognize and reconcile the poor handling that was faced.

      <Accordion value="dehumanisation-2" title={<span className="new-york" style={{ color: 'var(--color-fd-muted-foreground)', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>Bulls mother had seen the burial of too many Wakka Wakka kindred laid to rest in the Mission cemetery of sacred-red earth studded with white identical wooden crosses. The days of mourning and misery, misery and mourning, wave upon wave of Sorry Business, no justice and no reckoning for the innocent and the wretched.</span>}>
         Emotive language, repetition, and symbolism are all used to construct the theme of intergenerational Indigenous trauma. Too many Wakka Wakka kindred laid to rest suggests a history of systemic violence and neglect of Aboriginal people rather than individuals dying purely of natural causes. It signifies the amount of deaths as unnatural, and kindred describing how close they were in their own community, highlighting how it wasn’t just a coincidence that brought about the death of many of their people. Furthermore, the description of white identical wooden crosses symbolizes colonial control, erasing individuality and cultural suppression, underscoring the idea of imposed religion and uniformity of Aboriginal people. Finally, the repetition of mourning and misery to describe the endlessness of grief and inability to move forward past times of neglect and dehumanisation, highlighting the lack of accountability from the Australian people.

  <TabsContent value="addiction">
    The idea of addiction has been explored through a description of Bull's life after childhood. The following are references to alcohol in the story, all in relation to Bull. Danny, on the contrary, is shown as one who can control his impulses, is more responsible, and is able to have more educated decisions.
    <Accordions type="single">
      <Accordion value="addiction-1" title={<span className="new-york" style={{ color: 'var(--color-fd-muted-foreground)', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
      "You wanna stop 'ere in Fernvale ... Get a six pack for the drive?"
      <div className="h-4"/>
      Then the broken cowboy consumed painkillers to chase the hurt. Alcohol ... heroin ... chapters in detention.
      <div className="h-4"/>
      "You wanna stop in for one?"
      </span>}>
        - These comments all support the idea of how addiction has made its way into Bull's life, and that he struggles to go a short period of time without alcohol.
        - The dependency on alcohol to be a person and to live demonstrates how much Bull has fallen into the trap that has been laid out by Western society.
        - Chapters in detention poses the assumption that there was overconsumption of alcohol often involved, Bull becoming drunk and doing all sorts of things to end up in prison.
        - Constantly asking even though Danny had already said no evidences how much he is struggling without for only a few hours of driving, that when he is bored his go to was to drink alcohol, possibly get drunk, and then likely doing stupid things which was the result of the issues he faced.
