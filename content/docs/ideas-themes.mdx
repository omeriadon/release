    <Accordions type="single">
      <Accordion value="racism-1" title={<span className="new-york" style={{ color: 'var(--color-fd-muted-foreground)', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>"But the people out here had a gentle way as they moved. Arthritic hate. A bent neck that eased an arch at stranger."</span>}>
        The use of sentence length and exclusive language to construct the idea of racial discrimination, highlighting the hatred and views of dominancy held by those who have not yet adapted to the new times. Furthermore, this reflects upon a modern day society, how the lack of respect is still deemed to be absent in many towns who still share xenophobic views towards First Nations peoples.

      <Accordion value="racism-2" title={<span className="new-york" style={{ color: 'var(--color-fd-muted-foreground)', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>"White-folk kept to their pub on the left ... the black-folk kept to their places across the way."</span>}>
        Anaphora constructs the idea of separation between "black" and "white" folk, juxtaposing the modern day views of acceptance, with explicit emphasis on the racial discrimination Indigenous people are still up against to this day. Additionally, the italicizing of the words "white-folk" and "black-folk" foregrounds the theme of marginalization as classifying them as two different species rather than of being human, targeting the common perspectives of Aboriginal people face in the contemporary world.

      <Accordion value="racism-3" title={<span className="new-york" style={{ color: 'var(--color-fd-muted-foreground)', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>"A blackfulla driving a new, registered and reliable vehicle could even warrant a search in this deadness."</span>}>
        The irony of a new, registered and reliable vehicle being able to warrant a search implicitly articulating the idea racial profiling, constructing the idea that Indigenous Australians are not deemed suitable to have money, let alone a car, in in certain rural towns of Australia. It reflects the common stereotyping Australians have about Aboriginal People, criticizing the false pretenses and beliefs that must be eradicated from society.
