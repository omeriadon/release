Danny and Bull... Bull and Danny.

Some final splinters of sunlight jagged the hill-tops on the western rises before them.
Danny drove.
The petrol gauge read half a tank.
He and his cousin Bull would never have been caught dead in these remnants of day when they were kids.
Elders had warned of _red-eyes_ appearing on the edge of the unsealed road; meandering spectres making their journeys to haunt, claiming unpaid debts from the living.
Bull rode in the passenger seat of the car.
Danny had promised Bull's mother that they'd be home by dusk.


The sedan was reasonably new and slick; slick for this region anyway, carrying two dark passengers up the winding roads of the big valley that coursed west from River City.
Danny couldn't help feeling like a black <Annotation annotation="The sentence below uses literary conventions to do something idk">wraith moving through the</Annotation> numerous ghost towns on the backroads toward Murgon.

_"You wanna stop 'ere in Fernvale... Get a six pack for the drive?"_
Danny had heard that wayward anticipation in his cousin's voice.

_"Nah... I promised your mother, Bull..."_
The vehicle had already drawn stares from night-owls.
There were no welcome mats in these tiny communities.
A blackfulla from the city knew this in his blood.
But the people out here had a gentle way as they moved.
Arthritic hate.
A bent neck that eased an arch at strangers.

A flatland of shadows unfolded out of gumtrees and thicket.
Danny smelt the familiarity of lavender farms.
_"We're almost there, Bull..."_

His cousin had been quite subdued along the trip.
Even when they passed Wacol and the prison where Bull had been a "guest," the energy in the car was flat.
There was nothing Danny wanted to say anyway.
Some of the bricks had fallen from the childhood bond the men had built together.
Danny chose the city.
Bull earned a cracked pelvis on the rodeo circuit.
Bull found it hard to even ride a lawnmower after that.
Then the broken cowboy consumed painkillers to chase the hurt.
Alcohol... heroin... chapters in detention.

Danny finally eased the car into Murgon.
The suspension clapped over the dormant train crossing.
_White-folk_ kept to their pub on the left... the _black-folk_ knew their place across the way.
A solitary statue of an ANZAC held residence in the main-street division.
Danny looked over his shoulder briefly thinking he might see the lights of Cherbourg Mission behind the township, but there wasn't even a firefly's chance.
_Out of mind, out of sight._
Some traffic loomed.
A couple of dark faces checked up from their drinks.

_"You wanna stop in for one?"_ asked Bull.
Danny ignored his cousin's voice.
He glanced into the side-streets.
The constabulary weren't even lurking.
A blackfulla driving a new, registered and reliable vehicle could even warrant a search in this deadness.

_"Not far now..."_ whispered Danny.
Solar-flares were burring in the crests ahead of them.
There was no oncoming traffic.
Danny wondered for a moment whether or not he should tweak the headlights to high-beam and then decided against it.
Black wings of a crow sprang before the car.
Roadkill tarnished bitumen.
A crossroad loomed.
Danny recognised the silhouette of a broken sulky in a barren paddock.
Fingers of rustling cane.
Un-kept fences.
He aimed the car in a gentle manner onto a winding road that soon lost the smooth surface into wafting dust clouds.

_"Remember when Stewie swore he saw a devil-dog on this track one night?"_
The hairs sprang on the back of Danny's neck.
He regretted the memory instantly.
The lore in isolation of this place had earned his respect; some fear, but mostly a healthy respect.
Bull's father, who was now dead for thirty years, had tried to make his peace with the spectral matters here too.
But there was little point in keeping shades of the afterlife away.
Danny navigated in fragmented memory and weariness.
This was a place where the mind's eye tricked you.
A small parch of land sat ahead dropping into a gully.
Failing daylight, but nonetheless, Danny had brought his cousin to a place that was a birthright.
Thickets of blade grass were almost covering the shoulders of the road now and a track veered off into nothing.

The headlights of the car were consumed in the wilds of undergrowth.
And this was good.
Safety in cover.
A faceless bank manager had dispossessed the family any rights on the property for a generation.
Danny and Bull had aspirations of working these ridges as kids—more so Bull than Danny—but reality and economic rationalism hijacked those dreams.
Danny would soon be forty eight years old.
And degenerative natures had made their way into Bull's body for some time now too.

Danny thought about his fading passenger, the pile of belongings in the car that were his only worldly possessions.
Methadone.
Demons.
_Ah Bull! What did they do to you in prison?_
Once upon a time their elders had called the cheeky pair "Amigos."

Suddenly the wheels of the vehicle ran over metal.
It must have been the forgotten cattle grid that was too choked by weeds to be seen and it brought them both out of their stupors.

_"We're here mate!"_ said Danny.

_"I know,"_ chirped Bull.

Danny allowed gravity to do the rest and the vehicle rolled into a rough meadow next to the heap of a dilapidated dwelling.
A sturdy hardwood frame of the four walls had collapsed in, bringing down a hood of corrugated iron.
Small saplings were reclaiming floor.
The sun was poor but enough to pose light on the dim mushroom-cloud of a mango tree on the other side of the wreckage.

Bull's mother was too frail to even meet them up here.
As Danny cranked the door open a maze of shrub and grass met him in contention.
He realised he couldn't have even unfolded her wheelchair from the sedan to welcome her son home.

_"Come on then..."_

Strand and leaf fought against Danny as he waded out from the car.
He felt the cool air suppress his frame.
Green needles pricked.
Footing was difficult at first.
Blood began to circulate through his legs.
The leather boots and heavy denim jeans he wore gave him enough confidence to blindly track through the tangles.
He stomped several metres and then turned back to the car.

Danny reached in and cut the ignition, flicking the headlights off.
There was a calm and comfortable dimness that surrounded them.
Bugs chirped.
The sky almost mirrored the land in mats of luxuriant cloud morphing and jumbled as the earliest evening stars made an appearance.
The moon was too low yet to really show any influence.
In the pitch of this setting Danny felt his cousin's ease too.

_"I did promise your Mum, my Brother... Sorry we couldn't stop."_

Danny and Bull were both of Wakka Wakka blood and had returned to the tribal country of their Wakka Wakka forebears.
Bull's mother had seen the burial of too many Wakka Wakka kindred laid to rest in the Mission cemetery of sacred-red earth studded with white identical wooden crosses.
The days of mourning and misery, misery and mourning, wave upon wave of Sorry Business, no justice and no reckoning for the innocent and the wretched.

Danny stretched back into the car for a beige paper bag stamped "PERSONAL PROPERTY" with the aid of a few remaining lights that flickered in the dashboard.
It was the only light for miles around.
He struggled to pull a flat container carefully away from the crumpled garments and paperwork that some prison official had impersonally packaged.

_"You alright there Bull?"_ he gently whispered.

Firmly holding the container he stepped back into the grass and made trail through the soddened growth.
He moved about, the moisture of dusk gathering on the thickets, until he came to a clearing that gave access down into the folds of the land.
Motionless shadows and gullies lay beyond.

Danny paused and listened to his lush surroundings.

_"Here we go... cobber..."_ he said.
His throat dumped a solemn _gulp._
He puffed out his chest and called out to Bull, _"Ere mate... you're home now!"_

Danny carefully snapped open the lid on the container and assumed an odour would follow.
Some smell that might illustrate the prison stench; damp cold concrete and White Ox tobacco.
Angst.
The essence of what had become of his cousin, the ingredients of his life and pain.
He let the ash sift before him into the night.

_"There ya go bud..."_

Subtle breezes picked up the fine white powder and a rush of motion parted the grasses downhill and away.
Little paper-winged moths flocked out of the growth and danced in the flow of Bull's departure.
Danny saw fleeting seeds lift from thickets, joining the clicks of tiny grasshoppers excitedly jumping into the dusk.
Somewhere in the lower ridges a menagerie of bird noise erupted and a flowering bud of moonlight broke through cloud above the distant peaks of the tree line.
Bull's spiritual presence made small tumbling spirals that retreated into the scrub; finally at rest in playful communion with the country.

_"There ya go Bull... There ya go..."_

_"Danny and Bull... Bull and Danny..."_

_"Amigos..."_
