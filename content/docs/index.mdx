This documentation is split into 11 parts:

- **Overview of the Immune System** – Purpose, general structure, innate vs adaptive summary, systemic organization.
- **Immune Organs & Tissues** – Bone marrow, thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, MALT, microenvironments, primary vs secondary vs tertiary structures.
- **Innate Immunity** – Barriers (skin, mucosa), phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells), NK cells, complement pathways, pattern recognition receptors, inflammasomes, inflammatory response.
- **Adaptive Immunity** – B cells, T cells (helper, cytotoxic, regulatory, memory), antibodies, antigen presentation (MHC I/II), clonal selection, immunological memory, class switching, somatic hypermutation.
- **Molecular Mediators & Signaling** – Cytokines, chemokines, transcription factors, signaling pathways (NF-κB, JAK-STAT, MAPK, PI3K), growth factors, receptors.
- **Immune Responses to Pathogens** – Responses to bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites; immune evasion strategies; microbiome interactions.
- **Inflammation & Immune Regulation** – Acute vs chronic inflammation, resolution mechanisms, immune checkpoints, tolerance, regulatory cells.
- **Immunopathology & Disorders** – Autoimmunity, immunodeficiencies (primary, secondary), allergies/hypersensitivities, chronic inflammation, transplant rejection, graft-vs-host disease.
- **Vaccination & Immunotherapy** – Principles, vaccine types, monoclonal antibodies, CAR-T, checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine therapies.
- **Development & Aging** – Fetal and neonatal immunity, thymic involution, immunosenescence.
- **Systems Integration** – Neuroimmune interactions, endocrine-immune crosstalk, circadian regulation, metabolism-immune links.

that is chatgpt so fix it later
