**Why is the story called Release? What are the meanings of this? What does it refer to?**

The title "Release" has multiple implications on its meaning. On the literal side, it could refer to the release of Bull's ashes, or on the deeper side it could refer to the release of tension between him and Danny through his death. The story emphasizes how Danny and Bull's relationship thrived in childhood, as they dreamed of their futures together and had lots of fun, often being referred to as cheeky amigos by their elders. As their lives progressed, this friendship began failing, with Bull's addictions to alcohol, heroin, and meth, and Danny moving to the city.
